      <b>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b> has become a buzzword of sorts, but what does it mean for your bottom line? The reality is that most SEO services fail to perform and have only a spurious correlation to sales. The marketplace has matured to appreciate the liabilities of SEO services, so businesses have turned to paid <b>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</b> with clear results and an even more blatant price tag.  
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a happy middle ground. SEO done right yields an incredible profit, yet the payback period is typically 3 quarters or more. Paid SEM is reliable and immediately produces leads, albeit at a slim margin that must be managed closely to prevent any M/M losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The solution is simple: an investment in SEO from the very beginning, with its initial costs recuperated via a successful SEM campaign. Since SEO relies on assets that mature over months, it is essential to have some period of time for them to grow and it is precisely during that time in which we'll be growing your client list through targetted SEM.

       You may have done this before or it could be your first time. All that you know is this: you need to get your business online. That means a simple, clean, professional site should be set up, the faster and cheaper the better. You'll need some custom email addresses so the world knows you're legit and maybe a nice logo could top it all off.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that sounds like you, we've bundled the essentials up nicely just for you at this incredible deal. From our experience with start-ups, we also know there's a few things that might not have made it to the checklist that will serve you well in the long-haul. Specifically, you're going to want to be able to edit your site's content effortlessly, measure its popularity, and be able to set up landing pages for your first campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this package you'll get a beautiful and user-friendly WordPress site that will do all of the above. We'll set up your own custom emails in any client you'd like (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), cheaper than anyone else can do it. Most imporantly (you'll thank me later for this one), we make sure that you can create landing pages on your own so that you don't just have an online business card, but a bona fide digital salesman.

       Is it working yet? That's a question you should never need to ask. Web analytics has come a long way: we can now tell you exactly how long a prospect looks at your page, what they click, what they read, what they don't read, where they think about but don't quite make it, and where they buy. <b>Aren't you a little curious?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, all of these advancements in heatmaps, session playbacks, and advanced profiling have not arrived with simpler UIs. The most advanced analytics tend to correspond with equally sophisticated interfaces that demand as much of your time as they purport to save. Given the power to improve your messaging, excellent analytics remains a high-hanging fruit that promises to <b>guide your company toward your best clients</b> and save money with more targetted marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our analytics packages takes the best of all of these features and makes them accessible to you. We will measure your <em>real traffic</em> (minus the bots), show you where your website is being appreciated (and where it's not), and make all of these features easy to use. After all, <b>good web analytics is like watching foot traffic</b> in a brick-and-mortar store, just multiplied by a thousand!

       Nothing is free, and you know it. This is really a one-time offer to get to know our company and what we can do for you by removing all the risk that we can. We'll work closely with you to learn about your business and design a short campaign in which we guarantee that all expenses will be compensated via new revenue. If things don't go as planned, the cost is eaten by our agency; when we succeed, we both make a little money.</p> 
      <p>
       These kinds of Pay Per Lead contracts are very common in big-ticket sales industries, though we have successfully used them with small- and medium-sized businesses in many industries. Generally, such an agreement is rarely more profitable than consulting together and then purchasing assets. Yet, if you've never worked with an agency before or have had less pleasant experiences in the past, this is a great way to try us out, no-strings-attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you call or email, we will schedule a time to talk in-depth about the state of your business, what has (and hasn't) worked in the past, and the kinds of assets you have available to you to extend your reach. Usually, we'll put together a tentative marketing plan on the phone and put it in writing within the week. Once it's all sured up and clear to both of us, we'll pull the trigger and do the work. We'll be sure to set a small goal so as not to overwhelm your fulfillment capacities and we'll watch the sales come in together. By the end of the campaign, you'll have recouped our agency fee as well as whatever commission we asked... or your investment is returned!
